# .gif-tile
.gif-tile tiles a .gif (or any image file, for that matter) for "this .gif dances to anything" goodness.

This can also loop an audio file; to remove it, just leave the second field blank and click "update".

giftile was originally hosted at [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/tikodi), but I decided this needed its own domain name.
You can view it as a GitHub Page at http://giftile.me.

## Permalinks
Permanent links are generated by submitting the audio URL and the image URL to [Parse](https://www.parse.com).
The objectId we get from Parse is used as the link's ID. For example:

[`http://giftile.me/combo?id=oVN6Gv3s5R`](http://giftile.me/combo?id=oVN6Gv3s5R)
